Hi! I am Jennifer. I graduated from New College in 2020 and was part of the lab during my third and fourth years at NCF. I am currently in the Political Science Ph.D. program at Northwestern University. I study American Politics and Political Methodology, with a focus in political behavior, experimental methods, and public opinion.
